I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Washington, jointly advised by [Prof. Jacob O. Wobbrock](https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/) in the [ACE Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/acelab/) and [Prof. Shwetak Patel](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/members/) in the [Ubicomp Lab](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/). My research focuses on developing novel sensing techniques that seamlessly perceive and understand human behavior without interrupting daily life, with applications in interaction and health.

Prior to joining UW, I completed my undergraduate degree in [Intelligence Engineering and Creative Design](https://www.xyc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1082/1443.htm) and Master's in Computer Science at Tsinghua University, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chun Yu](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/ChunYu/) and [Prof. Yuanchun Shi](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1306/4332.htm). Outside of research, I enjoy singing and playing volleyball.

I look forward to sharing my work and collaborating with researchers in related fields to advance the intersection of sensing technologies, human-computer interaction, and ubiquitous computing.
